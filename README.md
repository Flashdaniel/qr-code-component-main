## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used CSS Grid to make sure that the attribution always stays at the bottom of the page.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="attribution">
  Challenge by
  <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank"
    >Frontend Mentor</a
  >. Coded by <a href="#">Your Name Here</a>.
</div>
```

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  grid-auto-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  justify-items: center;
}

.attribution {
  font-size: 1.4rem;
  padding: 4rem 1rem;
  align-self: end; /* to the bottom of the page */
}
```
